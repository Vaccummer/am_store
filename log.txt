   To force a re-execution of oneapi-vars.sh, use the '--force' option.
   Using '--force' can result in excessive use of your environment variables.
  
usage: source oneapi-vars.sh [--ia32] [--force] [--help] [...]
  --ia32 or ia32 Point to lib32 folder rather than 64-bit lib folder.
  --force        Force oneapi-vars.sh to re-run, doing so may overload environment.
  --help         Display this help message and exit.
  ...            Additional args are passed to the etc/*/vars.sh scripts
                 and should follow this script's arguments.
  
  Some POSIX shells do not accept command-line options. In that case, you can pass
  command-line options via the SETVARS_ARGS environment variable. For example:
  
  $ SETVARS_ARGS="--ia32" ; export SETVARS_ARGS
  $ . path/to/oneapi-vars.sh
  
  The SETVARS_ARGS environment variable is cleared on exiting oneapi-vars.sh.
